## ArticleSound
ArticleSound is a web app that allows users to easily convert news article URLs into audio recordings. It was built by our team of 3 within a week using the Watson Text-to-Speech API, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, jQuery, Materialize-Sass, AWS S3, and Heroku.

ArticleSound is live at: http://www.articlesound.com

## API Reference
Built using the [IBM Bluemix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/watson/) Watson Text-to-Speech REST API ([view documentation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/text-to-speech/)).
